                The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.

                Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called "Phases", with the first three phases collectively known as "The Infinity Saga" and the following three phases as "The Multiverse Saga". The first MCU film, Iron Man (2008), began Phase One, which culminated in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers. Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Phase Four began with Black Widow (2021) and concluded with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022). Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) began Phase Five, which will end with Blade (2025), and Phase Six will begin with Fantastic Four (2025). Phase Six and "The Multiverse Saga" will conclude with Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027).
            </p>
            <p>
                Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013 before further expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu and to cable television on Freeform. They also produced the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios began producing their own television series for streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. They also expanded to television specials in Phase Four, known as Marvel Studios Special Presentations, the first of which was Werewolf by Night (2022). The MCU also includes tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, and viral marketing campaigns for the films featuring the faux news programs WHIH Newsfront and The Daily Bugle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The franchise has been commercially successful, becoming one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time, and generally received positive reviews. It has inspired other film and television studios to attempt similar shared universes, and has also inspired several themed attractions, an art exhibit, television specials, literary material, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials.

            <p>Here, in the above list, we have listed down the name of all movies in chronological order (in the 5<sup>th</sup> column of the table) as per the chronological order or the official timeline (year) in which the movie was released by Marvel Studio itself. We have followed the chronological order of movie data very accurately and precisely as per the data given by the officials of Marvel Studio; otherwise, it becomes very difficult for us to follow a straight chronological order. This is because the chronological order of all the Marvel movies is very complicated, and the timeline of many movies mix up with each other, and it makes it very hard to follow a single chronological order for all the Marvel movies.</p>
            <h4 class="n">Note: In the above list, we have not mentioned Loki in all movies in chronological order, as you can see that we have left one place empty there. This is because that Marvel Studio hasn't officially revealed the chronological order for the Loki series, and its timeline mixes up with many phase-4 movies of Marvel Studio.</h4>
            <p>Now, we will describe all the Marvel movies mentioned in the above list with a brief description of each of them.</p>
            <table height="100" border="3">
                <tr> 
                <th>  
            <h3 class="h3">1. Iron Man (2008)</h3>
            <hr> 
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order1.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
                
            <p>  Iron Man was the first release of Marvel Studio's movies, released in the year 2008. Although it was not as successful as the prior franchise of Spider-Man, however, it was still capable of putting an impression. With a revenue of $585.2 million, it became the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year.</p>
            <hr>
           
            <h3 class="h3">2. The Incredible Hulk (2008)</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order2.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>The Incredible Hulk casting Edward Norton was the next release of the Marvel series after Iron Man. It was improved as compared to its precursors and earned $263.4 million.</p>
            <p>The achievements of Iron Man had an impact on the popularity of the movie. However, it was understandable who would be Marvel's flagship character among these two. However, the character gained enough achievements and fruition by doing subsidiary roles in various movies.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">3. Iron Man 2 (2010)</h3>
            <hr> 
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order3.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>Marvel Studios brought a movie in 2010, Iron Man 2. The direction was done by Jon Favreau, and the script was prepared by Justin Theroux. The movie earned $623.9 million at the box office, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of the year. But it was the ultimate approval of the superhero in 2010. Unluckily, the common accord of Iron Man 2 was that it could not match the impact of the first film's popularity.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">4. Thor (2011)</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order4.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>Dissimilar to the Iron Man movies, Thor was not the best-grossing released film of 2011. The film made a revenue of $449.3 million and proceeded ahead of the Hulk and Captain America. Critics applauded Chris Hemsworth's work in the film, and some were still questioning the capability of Marvel's franchise. They marked the shortcomings in Thor, which made Iron Man more splendid.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">5. Captain America- The First Avenger (2011)</h3>
            <hr>             
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order5.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>Marvel Studio released its fifth movie also in 2011, i.e., 'Captain America- The First Avenger.' Chris Evans played Captain America as the lead role in the movie, and this movie marked the entrance of Captain America into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). So, it may surprise many new Marvel fans, but yes, Thor, Hulk, and Iron Man all have their movies before Captain America.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">6. The Avengers (2012)</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order6.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>Finally, Marvel Studios came up with "The Avengers" in 2012. The movie reached the peak of success at the box office and left behind many of its tough competitors, including "The Dark Knight Rises," which was a sequel to Iron Man. The movie became the first Marvel movie that earned the proofing billion dollars, i.e., 1.5 billion dollars. The profit and success earned by the film are still unmatched until the release of "Avenger- Infinity War" after six years.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">7. Iron Man 3 (2013)</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order7.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>The movie made a revenue of 1.2 billion dollars and became the second movie to cross the billion dollars earning. Shane Black made a debut as a director that brought a big evolution of Tony Stark.</p>
            <p>Finally, the critics were satisfied with the storyline and applauded the movie as betterment of Iron Man 2, which was much better in the action-comedy genre. The movie was the biggest blockbuster of the year.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">8. Thor: The Dark World (2013)</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order8.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>The movie made a revenue of $644.6 million at the box office and became the tenth highest-grossing year of the year and was far better than the original one leaving behind Iron Man 2. Even after the ill-famed reputation of the film, it was not possible for the viewers to go and watch the movie.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">9. Captain America: The Winter Soldier</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order9.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>Captain America received mixed interest and positive feedback. The movie established itself as the powerhouse of the Marvel series with a box office gross of $714.3 million. Critics applauded the film and its political subtext, which is only attempted by very few superhero movies.</p>
            <p>The direction of the Russo Brothers and the script written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely did a phenomenal job, and the results were proof of that.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">10. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order10.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>In 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy was a movie that was highly successful in pushing the boundaries of viewers' interest. The film gathered $773.3 million, which was way too higher than any Thor or Captain America.</p>
            <p>Transformers: Age of Extinction and 'The Hobbit and The Battle of the five Armies' were only the two stiff competitors. The critics felt a connection with the film's irrelevant humour and elegance and also with the sentiments possessed by its unusual superheroes.</p>
            <hr>     
            <h3 class="h3">11. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order11.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>The Age of Ultron was the movie that made Marvel Studios listed in the billion-dollar empire once again. The film accumulated $1.4 billion, which was lesser than the first Avengers but still exists in the territory of cinematic kingship.</p>
            <p>Critics were not connected enough with the movie than the first movie. However, they adored the character interaction and the heroic moments in the movie.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">12. Ant-Man (2015)</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order12.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>The Ant-Man became the next big release of the Marvel studios in order. The studio had high expectations from the movie that it would springboard the office of Ultron's profit that was fulfilled by the movie. It made revenue of $519.3 million which was not enough earnings for the second phase. Either it was fatigue, or the marketing was unable to sell out the concepts as well as it did for the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>
            <p>Though, critics were fond of the Ant-Man and marked that the reduced scale of the movie performed in its goodwill and revived behind Paul Rudd's like potential as a well-intended but fighting father.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">13. Captain America: Civil War (2016)</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order13.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>Captain America: Civil War boosted the star-studded potential of an Avenger movie. The movie has beaten both Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and was declared the number-one movie of the year at the box office.</p>
            <p>With earnings of $1.2 billion dollars, Captain America: Civil War became the fourth movie to accumulate a billion dollars in earnings.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">14. Doctor Strange (2016)</h3>
            <hr>
            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/list/images/list-of-marvel-movies-in-order14.png" alt="List of Marvel Movies in order">
            <p>The movie was the second of the Third phase of the Marvel series. This was the longest phase that was fully boasted by various latest characters. Doctor Strange gathered $677.7 million at the box office. Marvel Cinematic Universe was pushed into a new direction with its Doctor Strange, which showed some very new plots and concepts. The story of the movie was mainly based on a doctor named Stephen Strange who had a car accident and how their life changed from thereon.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="h3">15. Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2</h3>
